# Voidvasion

![](godot/icon.png)

## Description

In this game, you place orbs to delay the void. Your core orb will eventually break. By strategically placing orbs, you can survive longer. After the game finishes, you receive a result depending on the time you stayed in the game. Can you survive longer than 3 minutes?

There are 5 different game modes with varying positions of void and core orbs.

You can play the game [here](https://arytherias.itch.io/voidvasion).

This game was originally made for [LOWREZJAM 2023](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023) in about 2 weeks. It has received updates since then.

## Game rules

Use your mouse to place orbs. Press "START" when you are finished.
You can also place orbs after pressing "START" but you cannot have more than 15 orbs at a time.

The game is over when one of your core orbs (initial orbs) breaks.

## Controls

The game is fully playable with your mouse.

* `MOUSE`
  * use your left mouse button to place orbs
  * keep it pressed while moving to place orbs when you reach possible spots
* `SPACE` - enable/disable fast forward
* `P`, `ESC` - pause game

## Tactical tips

* Orbs slow down the void significantly. Place your orbs in a way such that the void cannot reach your core easily.
* When orbs break, you can place new orbs. Try placing your orbs close to the void so that they break sooner.
* Try to predict which orb will break next so you can already think of a spot for your next orb.
* If many orbs break at the same time, you might have a very stressful time to place new orbs.
