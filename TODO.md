# TODO

* [ ] define orange color for buttons and message once

* [ ] improve end game screen
  * copy button is ugly
  * maybe use `()` or `-NEW GAME-` for buttons

* [ ] design different maps for difficulties
  * default
    * [ ] center orb on tilemap
    * [ ] remove weird black tiles

* [ ] button script should also add `> <` to all buttons

* [ ] find names for end game messages

* [ ] find names for difficulties
  * [ ] should fit theme
    * [ ] which theme?

* [ ] improve ui theme
  * [ ] issues with spacing above and below
    * label
    * button
  * [ ] issue when centering text with odd number of pixels in width

* [ ] allow placing more orbs when some are broken?

* (optional) improve export script by allowing export for windows, linux and web
  * fix it

* (optional) drag mouse to place orb when possible
  * this had issues and allowed placing orbs too close

* (optional) find better ui sounds
  * darker

* (optional) use svg file instead of png for icon

## Tasks for Paul `:-)`

* [ ] mobile support?
* [ ] place approaching tiles automatically
* [ ] improve tilemap system
* [ ] help fixing font issues

## Testing

* [ ] how long can one survive
  * 2:15 is possible
    * place orbs close to darkness
    * orbs should break often so that we can place many orbs

* [ ] messages should be adapted
  * depends on expected time when doing nothing
  * depends on difficulties

## To discuss

* [ ] name for game
* [ ] difficulties

## Issues

* [ ] sometimes neighbors of tiles are not found
  * wait until all tiles are set
  * then, connect signals to neighbors
  * then, emit `arrived`

* [ ] only 15 orbs have light at the same time
  * should be fine
* [ ] weird collision shape of orbs when placed
  * this does not hurt

* [ ] game should work in browser

## Design ideas

* [ ] is clicking wildly to place orbs a good idea?

* place orbs only at beginning
  * place orbs strategically
  * certain number depending on difficulty
  * then, wait for darkness
  * darkness wins after 1, 2 minutes
    * how long can you last?
  * no cursor orb
    * but still 4 white pixels to highlight where new orbs are placed
      * remove when maximal number of orbs is reached

* [ ] autogenerated maps

* [ ] when orb can be placed
  * highlight/pulsate number for orb

## Game name

* darkness
* light
* light into darkness
* invasion
* lightness
* luminous
* eclipse
* orb

## Itch

* [ ] prepare game page
* [ ] screenshots (very late)
  * before start
  * mid game
  * late game
  * end game screen
* [ ] gifs of game
  * show how placing orbs looks like
  * show how darkness spreads
* [ ] description
  * [ ] rules
  * [ ] goal
  * Small puzzle/tower defense game where you place light orbs to slow down darkness from spreading.

## Later

* [ ] delete unused images
  * orbs
    * use gradient2d instead?
  * tilemap

## Game setting

* protect orb
  * holy gem in center of map
  * or candle?
  * orb
* darkness invades world
* deploy protective _things_ to delay darkness
  * [ ] specify _things_
    * small gems?
    * small candles?
    * ghosts?
* how long can you delay the darkness?
* [ ] can you win?

## Implementation

### Orb placing

* [ ] orb placing with cursor
  * hold/press key
    * 1, 2, 3
  * click somewhere
    * detect collisions

### Tilemap

* [ ] place darkness tiles by hand
  * for each difficulty map
* [ ] place approaching tiles automatically

## UI

* [ ] display at same position (top center)
  * `orbs: 5/10`, `orbs: 10` (number in red when reached)
  * `start`
  * time

* [ ] start darkness (and timer) button
  * `turn off light`
  * `summon darkness`

* [ ] game end screen with text and `copy` button
  * display
    * Congratulations, you lost!
    * Can you survive longer?
    * You can paste your result in the comments!
    * time
    * difficulty
    * orb positions?
    * `copy` button

* (optional) pause game

* [ ] find nice font
  * e.g. 5 height
  * monospace

## Difficulty

* ~~weaker orbs~~
* more initial black tiles
* ~~size of map~~
* different background color
* more cores
* already placed orbs at bad positions
  * close to center
* random difficulty

## Graphics

* (optional) glitch effects?
* (optional) background with variation
