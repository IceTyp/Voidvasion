# Darkness TODO find better name

Thanks for downloading our game!

## Controls

Use your mouse to place orbs.
Press "START" when you are finished.
You can also place orbs during the game but you cannot have more than 15 orbs at a time.

The game is over when one of your cores (orange orbs) breaks. How long can you survive?

## Tactical tips

Try to place as many orbs as possible. If orbs are destroyed, you can place new orbs. Place orbs close to darkness so that they get destroyed sooner.
