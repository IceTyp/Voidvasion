# TODO

* [ ] fix game end message

* [ ] difficulty nightmare is too bright

* [ ] define orange color for buttons and message and heading... once

* [ ] improve ui theme
  * [ ] issues with spacing above and below
    * label
    * button
  * [ ] issue when centering text with odd number of pixels in width

## Blockers

* [ ] weird font issue
* [ ] game name
  * also check if it already exists

## Optional

* [ ] different sound/animation when core breaks

* [ ] improve end game screen
  * copy button is ugly

* improve export script by allowing export for windows, linux and web

  * darker

* use svg file instead of png for icon

## Tasks for Paul `:-)`

* [ ] mobile support?
* [ ] place approaching tiles automatically
* [ ] improve tilemap system
* [ ] help fixing font issues

## Testing

* [ ] how long can one survive
  * 3:00 is possible
    * place orbs close to darkness
    * orbs should break often so that we can place many orbs

* [ ] messages should be adapted
  * depends on expected time when doing nothing
  * depends on difficulties

* without pushing already approaching tiles
  * 1:53
  * 1:38
  * 1:30
  * 1:22, 1:18

* with push already approaching tiles
  * 1:11
  * 1:02
  * 1:04
  * 1:03

## To discuss

* [ ] name for game
* [ ] readme
* [ ] difficulties
* [ ] make game available on GitHub?
  * protect master branch

## Issues

* [ ] sometimes neighbors of tiles are not found
  * wait until all tiles are set
  * then, connect signals to neighbors
  * then, emit `arrived`

* [ ] only 15 orbs have light at the same time
  * should be fine
* [ ] weird collision shape of orbs when placed
  * this does not hurt

* [ ] game should work in browser

## Design ideas

* [ ] is clicking wildly to place orbs a good idea?

* place orbs only at beginning
  * place orbs strategically
  * certain number depending on difficulty
  * then, wait for darkness
  * darkness wins after 1, 2 minutes
    * how long can you last?
  * no cursor orb
    * but still 4 white pixels to highlight where new orbs are placed
      * remove when maximal number of orbs is reached

* [ ] autogenerated maps

* [ ] when orb can be placed
  * highlight/pulsate number for orb
